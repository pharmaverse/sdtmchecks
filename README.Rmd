The sdtmchecks package contains functions to identify common data issues in SDTM data. These checks are intended to be **generalizable**, **actionable**, and **meaningful for analysis**.


## Installation

You can install {sdtmchecks} via: 
``` r
install.packages("sdtmchecks", repos = "https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev")  
```

Or, you can install {sdtmchecks} from [GitHub](https://github.com/):
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pharmaverse/sdtmchecks")
```

## Use the package

The [Get started page](https://pharmaverse.github.io/sdtmchecks/articles/sdtmchecks.html) walks you through how the package can be used. 


## Data checks in the package

To search available data check functions, please see [this search page](https://pharmaverse.github.io/sdtmchecks/articles/search_checks.html).

If using R Studio (version v0.99.878 or later), an {sdtmchecks} *addin* enables searchable data checks in the Viewer panel of R Studio. The search Viewer addin can be opened via the Addins dropdown or entering `sdtmchecks::sdtmchecksSearch()` in the RStudio Console.

The main data check functions of the package are saved as R program files beginning with **"check_..."** and are referenced under the [Data Checks](https://pharmaverse.github.io/sdtmchecks/reference/index.html#data-checks) portion of the Reference page.


## SDTM version

This package aims to be SDTM version agnostic and does not require users to specify the version. 


## Contributing

This package has been developed internally at [Roche](https://www.roche.com/) since 2014. There may be areas where the checks expect Roche-specific SDTM implementation choices. Proposed additions or modifications should attempt to maintain generalizability for slightly different data standards across companies. For examples on how to do so and to learn more about contributing in general, please refer to the [Writing a New Check](https://pharmaverse.github.io/sdtmchecks/articles/write_a_check.html) page.  

If you have an idea for a new check but no time for development, please [open an issue](https://github.com/pharmaverse/sdtmchecks/issues).
